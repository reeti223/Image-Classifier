# Image-Classifier
This project creates an image classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset contains labeled images. After preprocessing, the CNN model is built with convolutional and pooling layers. Itâ€™s trained on a training set and evaluated on a test set, achieving reliable image classification results.
